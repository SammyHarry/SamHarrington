# Admin Guide

Update structured data in the `/data` directory using YAML files. Each page reads from these files at build time.

- `experience.yml` — work history entries
- `projects.yml` — project metadata
- `resume.yml` — resume details

Write notes/blog posts as MDX files in `/app/notes`. Each `.mdx` file becomes a route.
