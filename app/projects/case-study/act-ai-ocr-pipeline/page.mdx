# ACT_AI Scorecard OCR — Case Study

## Problem

Tournament results were captured on handwritten scorecards. Manual entry was slow and error‑prone, blocking real‑time analytics and leaderboards.

## Solution

- Built an OCR pipeline using PaddleOCR to detect and extract race entries
- Normalized player names, track labels, and per‑race scores
- Packaged the service with FastAPI for a simple upload API and Docker for reproducible runs
- Produced structured JSON/CSV outputs ready for analytics pipelines

## Result

- Automated parsing removes manual data entry for standard scorecards
- Consistent outputs integrate with an ELO/VR analytics stack
- Clear next steps: expand handwriting coverage, add validation UI, and publish a public demo when privacy allows
