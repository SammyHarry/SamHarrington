        #1 – Kyle Love – Taiwan

        Taipei is the cultural, economic and political hub of Taiwan. China
        claims its sovereignty

        although it is self-governed. 1992 agreement of peace agree on one
        nation two

        governments, which is now being strictly opposed. If 1992 would be void,
        the peace aspect

        would be void. China has economic power over them, which is the bottle
        neck, however

        Taiwan is mainly semiconductors, which is massive in the current world’s

        Asian Cookbooks in America

        Chinese cuisine has been shaped over China’s long history and when it
        was brought to

        America, it took on a whole new identity. The influx on Chinese
        Americans increased during the

        construction of the transcontinental Railway, pausing during the Chinese
        Exclusion Act, and

        picking back up again once the Act was disbanded. As a result of the

        Chinese Rail Workers Home Life

        When reading researching about the Chinese rail workers, I was drawn
        into their day-to-

        day life. The problem with researching about the life of the workers, is
        that many of the workers

        were undocumented and with that their day-to-day life went unrecorded.
        This presents many

        difficulties with reaching, much of the research is therefore

        Colonization of American Samoa and Hawaii

        American Samoa and Hawaii have different stories, but they both reflect
        a broader

        pattern of U.S. expansion. Hawaii was once an independent kingdom with
        its own government,

        culture, and international recognition. In the late 1800s, however, U.S.
        business interests—

        particularly in sugar and pineapple—started to tighten their grip. The
        turning point came in 1893,

        Korean War Brides

        When I first began researching the history of Korean War brides, I was
        immediately

        intrigued by the personal journeys these women took—traveling thousands
        of miles from a

        devastated Korea to start anew in the United States. The Korean War
        (1950–1953) left the

        Korean peninsula in chaos, and as American servicemen were stationed

        Model Minorities and Asian Stereotypes

        At first glance, being labeled a “model minority” might seem like a good
        thing. It’s

        usually tied to praise—calling Asian Americans hardworking,
        high-achieving, and successful in

        school and careers. But as I’ve learned more, I’ve realized that this
        stereotype doesn’t lift people

        up as much as it boxes them in. It creates unrealistic expectations,

        The aftermath of 9/11 and the War on Terror, is misunderstood as a war
        about places far

        away—countries I'd only seen in the news. But looking deeper, it became
        clear  that this wasn't

        just about battles fought abroad. It had real impacts right here, in our
        own communities. And

        while the news often talked about Islamophobia, I was surprised to

        Executive Order 9066 began the series of events that effectively
        incarcerated 110,000

        Japanese Americans with over two-thirds of those people being second
        generation Americans.

        The internment camps were constructed due to fear and heightened racial

        8% of practicing doctors in the United States—a figure highlighted by
        the American Association

        of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI). This statistic shows something

        Colonialism is an overlooked part of American history. Of course, there
        will be stories of

        the American patriots overcoming British colonial rule, however, rarely
        is told of the United

        States active participation in overseas colonialism. One such example is

        Vietnam Memorial

        The Vietnam Memorial is one of the most famous and praised memorials
        that can be

        found in Washington D.C. This is part from the seemingly simplistic
        structure that is rich in

        symbolism, and the sheer scale of the tragedy. This memorial was key to
        unlocking the idea of

        veteran support because the initial reaction to the war and as a result
        the veterans were sour.
