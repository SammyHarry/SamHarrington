  excerpt: >
    "Never give up hope, no matter how dark things seem" (Warner Bros. 2008).
    This

    sentiment rings true through all of George Lucas’s Star Wars films — none
    more clearly than

    Return of the Jedi. The main hero, Luke Skywalker, saves his friends from
    the evil empire

    multiple times on different planets... at the lowest point of the film, Luke
    is forced to watch his friends

    slowly die, helpless, before Darth Vader changes sides and helps Luke,
    losing his own life in the process.

- title: "Moana Means More: From Hula Auana to Cultural Authenticity"
  description: FMST 150 — Final paper comparing Moana (2016) vs. Blue Hawaii (1961) through cultural authenticity.
  link: /writing/fmst-final-essay.pdf
  excerpt: >
    In a world that strives to be better than yesterday, day-to-day changes may
    be unnoticed, yet over decades,

    improvements can be jarring. When rewatching Moana (2016), the feeling of
    childhood captivation soaked in as I was enveloped by the stories,

    myths, songs, and dance that it presented. On the other hand, Blue Hawaii
    (1961) had a different feeling; the focus was on appearances rather than
    traditions and culture.

    During the 50-year gap, a Hawaiian cultural revolution shifted the outward
    appearance of Hawaii from a marketing scheme to a deeper cultural
    representation.
