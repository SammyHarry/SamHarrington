  16 AI Things in 93 Days is a self‑paced, hands‑on learning experience for William & Mary staff, faculty, and community members. Inspired by the “23 things” model—and playfully named after W&M’s founding year—this program offers 16 short lessons exploring topics like text generation, image creation, ethics, and practical uses of generative AI. Grounded in a human‑centered approach, the program encourages thoughtful engagement with the technology. Participants can start anytime between July 8 and October 9 and complete as many “things” as they like.
